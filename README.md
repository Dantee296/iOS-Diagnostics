iOS-Diagnostics
===============

A simple iOS Diagnostics client. This app uses private APIs to import the iOS Diagnostics logs. I've done some simple reports and will add more in the coming weeks. 

You will need Cocoapods to run it.

Please note that the logs sometimes don't import when running through the debugger. Just try again via the refresh button.

This is a first cut and will need more polish.

Enjoy!
