iOS-Diagnostics
===============

A simple iOS Diagnostics client. This app uses private APIs to import the iOS Diagnostics logs. I've done some simple reports and will add more in the coming weeks. 

You will need cocoapods to run it.

Please not that the logs sometimes don't import when running the app through the debugger. Just try again.
